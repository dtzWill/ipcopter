ipcopter/docker

Contains 'Dockerfile's for creation
of ipcopter-ified docker containers
for easier testing of functionality.

(This allows me to break the system
in the container without harming
my development environment,
and makes 'clean up' from crazy
failures much easier)


Quick instructions:

1) Ensure have various build requirements installed (Go, etc)
1) Run build.sh script to rebuild components and construct testing container
  $ cd ./ipc-test
  $ ./build.sh
3) Launch a bash shell in the ipcopter-ized container you just made:
  $ docker run -i -t $USER/ipc-hook
  Libraries presently log events into /tmp/ipc.$PID.log, fairly verbosely O:).


Note:

Repeated use of this script will slowly
consume more disk space, since every build
is tagged as the next version of the container.

Cleaning old containers regularly is probably
a good idea, just like being sure to remove
images backing no-longer-running containers.
